title: Naming classes how to avoid calling everything a whatevermanager
---

Here's a little summary of what I learned from this question in the meantime.

Try not to create new metaphors (Nanny)
Have a look at what other frameworks do
Further articles/books on this topic:

What names do you find yourself prepending/appending to classes regularly?  
Whatâ€™s the best approach to naming classes?  
Book: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (Hardcover)  
Book: Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture (Hardcover)  
Book: Implementation Patterns (Paperback)  

And a current list of name prefixes/suffixes I collected (subjectively!) from the answers:

- Coordinator
- Builder
- Writer
- Reader
- Handler
- Container
- Protocol
- Target
- Converter
- Controller
- View
- Factory
- Entity
- Bucket

And a good tip for the road:

>Don't get naming paralysis.
>Yes, names are very important but they're not important enough to waste huge amounts of time on.
>If you can't think up a good name in 10 minutes, move on.
