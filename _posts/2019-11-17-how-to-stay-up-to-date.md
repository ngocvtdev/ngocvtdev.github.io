As a developer, stay up to date is really important. But how can we survive in the world of tech, which rapidly changes over and over?

I bought a Kindle last year, so every time I found an interesting blog/article I send it to my kindle to read it later. This way works quite well and I'm happy with it.
But after years, my list keeps growing and it's taken me hours just to go through the list and check for anything new.
Also, my Kindle reading list becomes unmanageable with more than 350 articles.
You know Kindle good for reading but suck for managing contents.

So I need to find a better way, after days of searching I end up with this combination:

Feedly + Pocket + P2K + Kindle = :heart:

# [Feedly](https://feedly.com) - organize, read and share what matters to you

So now I can check all the news in just one place, yeah [RSS is undead](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/07/rss-is-undead/)
I try to keep my list as short as possible, you don't need to know everything in the tech's world. Actually, you can't and you shouldn't

Many places don't offer RSS like  your `DEV weekly newsletter emails` or `DEV digest of top posts from my tags`.
Have you ever feel your inbox is full of daily/weekly newsletter?
There is a service can turn your email into RSS call [Kill The Newsletter]( https://www.kill-the-newsletter.com)


# [Pocket](https://app.getpocket.com/)
I use Pocket to manage my reading list, and [P2K](https://p2k.co) to schedule send articles to my Kindle every week, so I can read in the weekends
I also have a simple tagging map to help me organize the articles better, so I can easily find what I want
