<p>I tried to use vim more than a year ago and I like the vim’s way to editing text!
My main language was Java at that time so I used vim plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.
I switch to Go fews months ago.
My first text editor for go was <code class="highlighter-rouge">VS Code</code> + <code class="highlighter-rouge">VSCodeVim</code> plugin
Everything is good, vs code is excelent editor
But why I use vim plugin all the time?
Should I try to set vim for Go?
I work a lot with terminal so maybe it’s will better to use vim
Or at least, vim make me look cooler :))
So I starting to setup vim and here is my tips for you to getting started with vim</p>

Any time you add a plugin, you need to read the document about it, how to config it,…</li>
  <li>Watch some vim casts to see how other people use vim</li>
