# Minimal vim config for Go
I tried to use vim more than a year ago and I like the vim's way to editing text!
My main language was Java at that time so I used vim plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.
I switch to Go fews months ago.
My first text editor for go was `VS Code` + `VSCodeVim` plugin
Everything is good, vs code is excelent editor
But why I use vim plugin all the time?
Should I try to set vim for Go?
I work a lot with terminal so maybe it's will better to use vim
Or at least, vim make me look cooler :))
So I starting to setup vim and here is my tips for you to getting started with vim

You should watch this!

# Tips
- start with `vimturor`, just hit `vimtutor` in your terminal
```bash
 $vimtutor
```

- start with small `.vimrc` then adding your own config to it.
Any time you add a plugin, you need to read the document about it, how to config it,...
- Watch some vim casts to see how other people use vim
- `:help` command is very helpful
Every time you don't know about a something, type `:help keyword`
- [Mapping](http://learnvimscripthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/03.html) is very helpful, write your own mapping
- Learn slowly
