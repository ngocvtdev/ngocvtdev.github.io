title: '[SOLID] Single Responsibility Principle'
---
## Definition
>A class or module should have one, and only one, reason to be changed

<!--more-->
Because of confusion around the word "reason", Martin wrote a blog post entitled [The Single Responsibility Principle](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/08/SingleReponsibilityPrinciple.html) with a goal to clarify what was meant by the phrase "reason for change." in 2014.  


Another wording for the Single Responsibility Principle is:

>Gather together the things that change for the same reasons.
>Separate those things that change for different reasons.

The reasons for change are people. It is people who request changes. 
And you donâ€™t want to confuse those people, or yourself, by mixing together the code that many different people care about for different reasons.

## God Object
In Object Oriented Programming, we also have a term `God Object`
> A God object is an object that `knows too much or does too much.`

Imagine you have a class look like this:
```java
class UserController{
  private DBConnection conn;
  private MailTemplate mailTemplate;
  public UserController(DBConnection conn,MailTemplate mailTemplate)
    
  public List<User> getUserList();
   public User getUserByEmail(String email);
  
  public renderHtml(List<User> users);
  
  public void sendEmailTo(String email,String content);
}
```
Wherever you wan to reuse `getUserList` method, you need to create new instance of `UserController`,
which require a `MailTemplate`.  
Why do you need to know about `MailTemplate` when you just want to query to database?  
And wherever you want to send an email you also need a `DBConnection`?
How can you maintain a class with 1000 lines of code?

>Keep classes small  
>Keep methods small

This will improve readability of you code and also make code more clean
### Refactor God Object
```java
class UserController{
  private MailSender mailSender;
  private UserService userService;
  public UserController(UserService userService, MailSender mailSender)
  public renderHtml(List<User> users);
}

class MailSender{
  private MailTemplate mailTemplate;
  public void sendEmailTo(String email,String content);
}

class UserService{
  private DBConnection conn;
   
  public List<User> getUserList();
  public User getUserByEmail(String email);
}
```
Now you can reuse your class easily
